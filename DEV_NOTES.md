## _(2026-09-06)_ — external dependency ledger skeleton

- Created `docs/dependencies/external-ledger.yaml` from `ROADMAP.md` §7.4: one entry per protocol/SDK/CLI/provider/harness, `checked_at` dated, a `revalidation_trigger` per row.
- Stubbed MCP, A2A, Codex, and Claude rows from the 2026-09-04 corrected baseline (§28.1). `license` is `"unverified"` until a spike records it from package metadata — never asserted from memory.
- Validated with `ruby -ryaml` (4 entries, required fields present) so the file parses clean before it is committed.

## _(2026-09-05)_ — KICKOFF.md is a companion, not a second roadmap

- Director dropped both `ROADMAP.md` (v0.4.1 master) and `KICKOFF.md` (Phase 0 execution).
- They are one pair: the master is frozen scope/gates; the kickoff is the Phase 0 task board.
- Promoted to `docs/decisions/2026-09-05_kickoff-companion-to-roadmap.md` (`answers:` present).

## _(2026-09-04)_ — a template's trial must include the first commit

- Every gate was green on the generated project and the first commit still failed: the doctrines judge STAGED
  code, and nothing had been staged until the user tried. Trial the path a user walks, to its end.
- `grep -c` prints `0` and exits 1. `$(grep -c … || echo 0)` therefore yields `0⏎0` — a second line — which
  here started a flush-left line inside a checklist bullet and hid its evidence from the box-scoped extractor.
  Capture the count, then default the empty case; never append a fallback to grep's own output.

## _(2026-09-04)_ — a green gate that judges nothing is the class a template must not ship

- Two of the four doctrine ports in `.2.6` were wrong on first run and their own RED self-test arms said so:
  a `python3 - <<'PY'` detector whose stdin was the heredoc (every arm read 0 rows), and a `grep -c … | grep -qx 0`
  control under `pipefail` (`grep -c` prints 0 and exits 1). A self-test with only GREEN arms would have passed both.
- The neutrality bar is measured, not felt: `grep -ciE 'grammar|parser|…'` over each ported script → 0, after the
  generic uses of "corpus" and "grammar" were re-worded ("tree", "syntax") so the count means what it says.

Detailed technical notes — root cause, implementation, validation — per slice. The
engineering-continuity surface (not the public docs; that's `docs/book/`). Newest first.

## _(YYYY-MM-DD)_ — bootstrap

Repo created from the `bedrock` template: durable 4-layer memory, task-tree tracking, the
strict commit workflow, and the mechanical doctrine enforcer are in place and enforced by
git hooks + CI. No project code yet.
