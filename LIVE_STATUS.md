# LIVE_STATUS.md — authoritative live progress tracker

Rows use only **Done · Mostly Done · In Progress · Not Started**. This is a current
snapshot. Historical implementation and verification records live in the phase
task-trees and git; the pre-review snapshot is `9c2d2ba:LIVE_STATUS.md`.

## Qualification correction

The full startup source read found open invariant failures and coverage gaps.
Historical phase closure does not establish current production qualification.
`docs/tasks/SIGNOFF-REPAIR.md` owns reproduction, fixes and requalification;
`docs/tasks/artifacts/signoff_review/INDEX.md` preserves the source evidence.
The runner cleanup and spawn/signal defects now have runtime controls and fixes;
foreign-target revocation and repeated-revoke epoch defects are reproduced; the
`.3.1` correction passed 34 focused tests and strict lint. Shared writes by frozen
tenant admins are now runtime-confirmed. The new site service passes ten live
controls and strict focused lint; the protected CLI passes its live controls.
All seven HTTP registry operations now use site authority and pass eight focused
HTTP controls plus adjacent checks; other repairs remain open.

| Area | Status | Current evidence and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap and task-tree conversion | Done | `PROGRAM` maps all phases, gates, backlog items, ADRs and demonstrations; `RB-SEED.2` holds the original census. |
| Claim-verification policy | Done | Local policy matches the director-authorized pgen donor at the startup comparison; subsequent claims still need all three verification legs. |
| Discipline and continuity | In Progress | Repair ownership is recorded; `.2` and `.11` own local storage, disposable verification, doctrine defects and document containment. `.11.4.1` rotates the recent changelog through verified Git history; broader containment remains open. |
| Phase 0 — contracts and experiments | Mostly Done | Historical G0 package and owner signoff retained in `PHASE-0`; affected authority/budget/adapter assertions require corrective evidence. |
| Phase 1 — LAN vertical slice | Mostly Done | Historical demonstration retained in `PHASE-1`; current authority, console and demo-script findings remain open. |
| Phase 2 — identity, delivery and recovery | Mostly Done | Historical machinery retained in `PHASE-2`; revocation, fencing, budget and recovery repairs are `.3`–`.4`. |
| Phase 3 — directory and recruitment | Mostly Done | Historical machinery retained in `PHASE-3`; tenant visibility, recruitment and automatic initiation repairs are `.5`. |
| Phase 4 — resources and evidence | Mostly Done | Historical G4 record retained in `PHASE-4`; acquisition isolation, evidence integrity and retention repairs are `.7`. |
| Phase 5 — deliberation and evaluation | Mostly Done | Historical G5 subtraction gate withdrew the quality-lift claim; workflow and evaluation repairs are `.8`. |
| Phase 6 — governance | Mostly Done | Historical G3 machinery exit retained; binding use remains gated; policy/publication/deployment repairs are `.9`. |
| Phase 7 — Internet qualification | Mostly Done | Hardening machinery exists; G6/G7 Internet exposure remains NOT MET. Local repairs and external threat-model, injection and penetration-test evidence remain required. |
| Phase 8 — federation and interoperability | In Progress | Through regional routing historically recorded; `.5.3` store-and-forward, `.5.4` exit export/import and `.6` G8 remain. Shared authority and protocol gaps are prerequisite repairs. |
| Phase 9 — stable release | Not Started | G9 requires sustained operational evidence and the outstanding release decisions. |
| Corrective review | In Progress | `.1`, `.2.1`, `.2.2`, `.3.1` complete; `.3.2.1` site service passes ten live controls and strict lint. `.3.2.2` operator CLI passes 3 live controls plus adjacent service/ownership checks and strict lint; `.3.2.3` HTTP enforcement passes 8 focused controls; the selected 58-test security run and final 12-test registry run pass. `.3.3.1` core subject serialization passes 49 unit + 3 subject controls and 40 live compatibility tests; `.3.3.2` bound evaluation passes 51 core unit + 3 subject tests, 6 evaluator controls, 32 live authority/command API tests and strict lint; all results consumed and the owned cluster removed. `.3.3.3.1` actual-parent command selection passes 37 live tests, six evaluator controls and strict lint. Frozen-admin read selection and tenant effect-audit/transaction work remain `.3.3.3.2`–`.3.3.4`. |

The shared adapter/region registry design is now explicit site-operator authority.
The separate site service implements that design. HTTP handlers call that service under `.3.2.3`, with live cross-tenant/freeze,
actual-parent, audit/rollback, wire-input and revocation-race controls.
