# LIVE_STATUS.md — authoritative live progress tracker

Rows use only **Done · Mostly Done · In Progress · Not Started**. This is a current
snapshot. Historical implementation and verification records live in the phase
task-trees and git; the pre-review snapshot is `9c2d2ba:LIVE_STATUS.md`.

## Current status

| Area | Status | Current evidence and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap and task-tree conversion | Done | `PROGRAM` maps all phases, gates, backlog items, ADRs and demonstrations; `RB-SEED.2` holds the original census. |
| Claim-verification policy | Done | Local policy matches the director-authorized pgen donor at the startup comparison; subsequent claims still need all three verification legs. |
| Discipline and continuity | In Progress | Repair ownership is recorded; `.2` and `.11` own local storage, disposable verification, doctrine defects and document containment. `.11.4.1` rotates the recent changelog through verified Git history; broader containment remains open. |
| Phase 0 — contracts and experiments | Mostly Done | Historical G0 package and owner signoff retained in `PHASE-0`; affected authority/budget/adapter assertions require corrective evidence. |
| Phase 1 — LAN vertical slice | Mostly Done | Historical demonstration retained in `PHASE-1`; the console review (`.11.1`) is closed with a real-browser control; current authority and demo-script findings remain open. |
| Phase 2 — identity, delivery and recovery | Mostly Done | Historical machinery retained in `PHASE-2`; revocation, fencing, budget and recovery repairs are `.3`–`.4`. |
| Phase 3 — directory and recruitment | Mostly Done | Historical machinery retained in `PHASE-3`; tenant visibility, recruitment and automatic initiation repairs are `.5`. |
| Phase 4 — resources and evidence | Mostly Done | Historical G4 record retained in `PHASE-4`; acquisition isolation, evidence integrity and retention repairs are `.7`. |
| Phase 5 — deliberation and evaluation | Mostly Done | Historical G5 subtraction gate withdrew the quality-lift claim; workflow and evaluation repairs are `.8`. |
| Phase 6 — governance | Mostly Done | Historical G3 machinery exit retained; binding use remains gated; policy/publication/deployment repairs are `.9`. |
| Phase 7 — Internet qualification | Mostly Done | Hardening machinery exists; G6/G7 Internet exposure remains NOT MET. The director greenlit Internet exposure over HTTPS with OAuth on 2026-09-25, security first; owner-only first (the director and their own agents), gated by our own evidence; opening to anyone else still needs an independent threat-model review and penetration test (`docs/runbooks/external-security-review.md`). Local repairs and external threat-model, injection and penetration-test evidence remain required. |
| Phase 8 — federation and interoperability | In Progress | Through regional routing historically recorded; `.5.3` store-and-forward, `.5.4` exit export/import and `.6` G8 remain. Shared authority and protocol gaps are prerequisite repairs. |
| Phase 9 — stable release | Not Started | G9 requires sustained operational evidence and the outstanding release decisions. |
| Corrective review | In Progress | `.1`, `.2.1`, `.2.2`, `.3.1` complete; `.3.2.1` site service passes ten live controls and strict lint. `.3.2.2` operator CLI passes 3 live controls plus adjacent service/ownership checks and strict lint; `.3.2.3` HTTP enforcement passes 8 focused controls; the selected 58-test security run and final 12-test registry run pass. `.3.3.1` core subject serialization passes 49 unit + 3 subject controls and 40 live compatibility tests; `.3.3.2` bound evaluation passes 51 core unit + 3 subject tests, 6 evaluator controls, 32 live authority/command API tests and strict lint; all results consumed and the owned cluster removed. `.3.3.3.1` actual-parent command selection passes 37 live tests, six evaluator controls and strict lint. `.3.3.3.2.1` frozen-read eligibility passes 40 live tests, ten pure evaluator controls and strict lint; all results consumed and the owned cluster removed. `.3.3.3.2.2.1` provenance and strict record/selector decoding passes 51 core units, seven metadata/subject controls, 44 live authority/HTTP/upgrade tests and strict lint; all confirmation/shutdown results consumed, owned cluster removed. Seven HTTP inspection receipt producers pass 45 live authority/API tests, ten pure evaluator controls and strict lint; all results and shutdown consumed. Exact scoped receipt readback passes 18 live authority tests and 30 HTTP tests plus strict lint, including final denied-record readback; all results/shutdown consumed. Actual-parent selection and frozen-read audit/readback `.3.3.3` are complete; The `.3.3.4.1` source census/contract is complete (42 named-call locations plus transitive/mutation coverage). `.3.3.4.2` qualifies the guard/connection owner and migration delivery: 35 controls (34 live / one pure), 28 directory rebuild/cache checks and four-crate strict lint pass, including cancelled-BEGIN replacement and the formerly stale authority executable. Seven acceptance-checker controls also pass, correcting nested-evidence owner selection while preserving real-tree box refusals. All results/shutdown consumed; owned clusters/probes removed. Grant error classification `.3.3.4.3.1` passes 56 live authority/HTTP/card controls and focused strict lint: storage causes survive, malformed active data returns safe 500, genuine structural 400s and exact failure/recovery effects are verified. All results/shutdown consumed; four owned clusters absent. Standalone writer/status integration `.3.3.4.3.2` now passes 85 selected controls (84 live / one pure), focused strict lint and book checks: five guarded paths, live parent issuance, preserved malformed status, public commit uncertainty and exact race/failure/recovery controls. The old contention fixture now verifies the observed target→guard dependency. All results/shutdown consumed; three owned clusters absent. Typed rollback support `.3.3.4.3.3.1` passes 89 selected controls (88 live / one pure), focused strict lint and rendered book checks: domain errors roll back provisional rows/new anchors, existing anchors remain, deferred anchor faults cannot replace refusals, and SQL causes/deadlines/commit uncertainty survive. All results/shutdown consumed; both owned clusters absent. Complete enrollment `.3.3.4.3.3.2` passes 97 selected controls (96 live / one pure), final focused strict lint and rendered book checks: one exclusive transaction before replay through every write, database-time liveness, honest concurrent replay, complete rollback and preserved commit phase. All results/shutdown consumed; three owned clusters absent. Bootstrap uncertainty `.3.3.4.3.3.3.1` is now runtime-confirmed: a 500 commit-uncertain response can precede the original committed tenant, and a repeated no-key request creates a distinct tenant. All 25 selected controls (24 live / one pure), focused strict lint and book checks pass; all results/shutdown consumed, owned cluster absent. Server bootstrap recovery `.3.3.4.3.3.3.2` passes 73 selected controls (72 live / one pure), the final eleven-control fixture rerun, three-crate all-target strict lint and final fixture lint. Canonical RequestId, complete guarded outcomes, exact conflicts, concurrent rollback/replay, actual commit/response-loss recovery, malformed-storage refusal and one shared deadline are qualified. All results/shutdown are consumed and four owned clusters are absent. StateFile storage `.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.1.1` passes twelve selected controls, all-target CLI strict lint and rendered book checks. Linked-target overwrite, changed open-reader snapshots and ignored process exclusion are repaired; strict bounded preservation and synchronized replacement are qualified on the native macOS repository volume. All results are consumed and unique fixtures are absent. Whole CLI writer integration `.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.1.2` passes nineteen selected controls, final all-target CLI strict lint and book checks: pre-dispatch exclusion, fresh actor/merge, both overlap orders, process-loss release and preserved real-server flow/denials. All results/shutdown are consumed; unique fixtures and the owned cluster are absent. Recovery schema `.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.1` passes twenty-four selected controls, all-target CLI strict lint and book checks: strict pending/completed records, preserved legacy wire shape, guarded multi-publication continuity and zero-dispatch refusal while pending. All results are consumed and unique fixtures absent; the interrupted pre-main launch and unchanged-binary successful retry are preserved honestly. Keyed CLI/explicit recovery `.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.2` passes thirty-three selected controls, final output-window rerun and strict CLI lint: durable matching request before dispatch, original-byte complete reply checks, same-key failure recovery, historical local receipt recovery without HTTP and deliberate distinct fresh tenant creation. The actual unread-output interruption retains its original result; all results/shutdown consumed, unique fixtures and owned cluster absent. Completion-capacity preflight `.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.3.1` passes thirty-one selected controls, final fresh/pending/exact-fit matrix and strict CLI lint: an oversized completion refuses before HTTP with exact snapshot/pending preservation, while the exact-limit case succeeds. All results consumed and unique fixtures absent; sizing samples never become outcome evidence and physical disk reservation is not claimed. Bounded HTTP waits and restart qualification follow; ordinary no-key behavior remains intentionally distinct. The final administrative effect REPRESENTATION `.3.3.4.7.1` passes 10 representation controls within 68 core tests, strict core lint and the falsified object-only control; its census derives the closed fourteen-operation set from 27 guarded-admission call sites. Its STORAGE `.3.3.4.7.2` then passes 8 live controls (falsified 5/3 against three attributable injections): migration 0058 keyed on the admission with a composite tenant-binding foreign key, a writer on the caller's already-guarded transaction, and a tenant-filtered reader. `.3.3.4.8` is the first producer of an effect record; `.3.3.4.9` is the second, putting spend-breaker arm/reset onto one exclusive-guard transaction — 25 live controls, the affected set 5 suites / 94 tests, falsified 17/8 against the exact pre-`.9` handlers.. Fixture ownership `.11.2.1.1` censuses all 61 `create_dir_all` sites in tracked Rust with 0 unresolved and repairs the 3 that adopted: exclusive per-call creation on the repository volume, falsified against an occupied path, with 89 selected controls across five suites (63 of them `profiles` on a disposable cluster), strict lint for both crates and the 25-check gate green. |

## 2026-09-26 — The tool recovers from being killed at any moment of its own saves (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.3.3`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0544`.

- ✅ **Checked:** the tool was killed outright at seven exact moments between its own saves, including half-way through writing its file. Every time, running the same command again finished the job correctly: the same enrollment and no duplicate. Nothing needed fixing.
- ✅ **Closed:** this finishes the enrollment-recovery work and five parent tasks with it. The only kind of blocking issue that could lose or corrupt data now has no open items left.

## 2026-09-26 — A killed tool's leftover helper no longer gets a misleading error (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.3.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0543`.

- ✅ **Checked:** if a program using the tool is killed while a process it started still holds the tool's lock, other runs are refused at once, nothing is damaged, and everything works again once that process ends, including a pending enrollment.
- 🔴 **Fixed:** the refusal said to wait for "another writer" to finish, but in this case there is no writer left to finish. It now names the real holder and says what to do; the guide explains how to find and end it safely.

## 2026-09-26 — Enrollment recovery survives a server restart (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.3.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0542`.

- ✅ **Checked:** if the server restarts after an enrollment whose answer was lost, retrying fails while the server is down (keeping its key), then returns the original person and organisation once it is back, with no duplicate. Nothing needed fixing.
- 📝 **Corrected:** the guide said write failures were untested; they are tested at every step of a save. It now lists exactly what is and is not tested.

## 2026-09-26 — What is left of testing the tool's recovery under interruption, measured (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.3`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0186`.

- 🔍 **Found:** six of the nine situations this task names are already tested. Three are not: the server restarting between a lost answer and the retry, the tool being killed while a child process still holds its lock, and a kill at the moments between the tool's own saves.
- 📋 **Next:** one sub-task each, in that order.

## 2026-09-26 — The command-line guide describes the recovery the tool has (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.4.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0541`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the guide said the tool could not recover a lost enrollment ("not implemented yet"), which it has done since an earlier repair; another chapter said the same, and said an enrolled person gets nine admin rights where the code grants fourteen.
- ✅ **Now:** the chapters describe what the tool does, with the output and refusals it actually prints, and a test checks every example against the code that reads the real files. This finishes the request-recovery task; its testing under interruption (a killed process, a restarted server) is next.

## 2026-09-26 — The command-line tool checks the server's reply before saving it (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.4.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0540`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when enrolling someone into an existing organisation or creating a thread, the tool saved what the server answered without checking it. A reply naming a different organisation was saved as the person's organisation, and a reply missing an ID produced an error blaming the tool's own files.
- ✅ **Now:** a reply that does not answer the request is refused as the server's error and nothing is saved. Checked against a real server, and by deliberately breaking the check 14 ways (every way that compiles was caught).

## 2026-09-26 — What is left of the command-line tool's enrollment recovery, measured (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.3.3.4.3.3.3.3.2.4`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0185`.

- 🔍 **Found:** the task list expected old recovery code to remove, and there is none. What is left: the command-line guide still says the tool cannot recover a lost enrollment, which it has done for weeks; ordinary enrollment and thread creation save the server's reply without checking it against the request.
- 📋 **Next:** the reply check first, then the guide. A smaller display issue (a missing list printed as "0") is deferred, with its trigger named in the qualification chapter.

## 2026-09-26 — Every malformed request now gets a reason code (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.36`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0539`.

- 🔴 **Before:** on 52 of the server's routes, a request whose body was not valid for the route got back a plain sentence with no reason code, although the error reference promises every refusal a code a program can act on.
- ✅ **Now:** every such refusal carries the code `invalid_command` and a message naming the problem field, on both the main API and the node channel. The status numbers stay as they were: 422 means the body has the wrong shape, 400 that it is not JSON at all.

## 2026-09-26 — Tests no longer leave empty folders behind, and the scripts review is complete (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.6`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0538`.

- 🔴 **Before:** every successful run of the backup test left an empty folder behind (46 had piled up).
- ✅ **Now:** a successful run cleans up after itself and the test checks that it did; a failed run keeps its folder for inspection. The 46 empty folders are gone. This completes the review of the operational scripts (`.11.3`): backup, restore, development environment, demonstration and load test.

## 2026-09-26 — The demonstration's "this did not happen" checks can no longer pass by accident (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.7`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0537`.

- 🔴 **Before:** three of the demonstration's checks that something did NOT happen would also pass if the tool doing the checking failed, and the responses it keeps as evidence were kept without noticing when a request had failed.
- ✅ **Now:** each of those checks first requires the tool to have worked, a failed request in the evidence is reported as a failure, and the check that the restarted server accepts a node requires a genuine acceptance.

## 2026-09-26 — The load test measures exactly what it was asked to (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.4`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0536`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the load test could run more requests than asked (10 became 16), reported success when asked to run none, could hang forever on one stuck request, and mixed failed requests into its speed figures, so fast failures made the system look faster.
- ✅ **Now:** it runs exactly the number asked (or refuses), gives up on a request after a set time, and reports speed only over requests that succeeded, with failures listed beside them. The speed figures published on 2026-09-08 were not affected.

## 2026-09-26 — The development environment checks its own server and cleans up honestly (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.3`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0535`.

- 🔴 **Before:** if another copy of the development environment was already running, a self-check reported success by talking to the other copy; the cleanup deleted the database folder even when the database had not stopped, and said all was well; and it could not be started from outside the project folder.
- ✅ **Now:** it checks that it is talking to its own server, deletes the database folder only once the database has stopped (and says so plainly if it cannot), and works from any folder.
- 🔎 **Found and tracked:** some of the demonstration's "this did not happen" checks would pass even if the tool running them failed (`.11.3.7`).

## 2026-09-26 — The demonstration checks it is talking to its own server, and its two-host mode works (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.5`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0534`.

- 🔴 **Before:** if another program already used the demonstration's port, the demonstration carried on talking to it without noticing; it copied the database address, user included, into the evidence it produces for sharing; and its documented two-host mode could never have worked (paths were quoted in a way that broke them, the node program was looked for in the wrong folder, and a check looked at the wrong machine).
- ✅ **Now:** the demonstration stops at once if its own server did not start, the evidence shows the address without the user, and the two-host mode passes every check in a same-machine rehearsal (not yet between two real machines).

## 2026-09-26 — A backup is never half-written and never readable by others (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0533`.

- 🔴 **Before:** an interrupted backup left a partial file under the name of a real one; the backup, a plaintext copy of the whole database, was readable by other users; and the database password was visible on the backup tool's command line.
- ✅ **Now:** a backup appears under its name only once it is complete and never replaces another, only its owner can read it, and the password is passed privately.

## 2026-09-26 — The restore test can no longer overwrite the live database (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0532`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the restore test wiped and replaced whatever database it was pointed at, including the live one, and passed the database password on its command line, where other users of the machine could read it.
- ✅ **Now:** it refuses the live database by name and any database that already holds data, before touching anything, and it hands the connection details to the database tools privately rather than on the command line.

## 2026-09-26 — The operational scripts reviewed: six problems to fix (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.3`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0183`.

- 🔎 **Found:** the restore script will wipe whatever database it is pointed at, the live one included; the database password is visible to other users on the machine while the backup, restore, load and demo scripts run, and the demo copies it into its shareable evidence; a backup that is interrupted leaves a partial file that looks complete; the development and load scripts can report success while talking to a different program on the same port; the load test runs more requests than asked and mixes failures into its speed figures; and one test leaves an empty folder behind on every run (34 so far).
- ✅ **Next:** each script gets its own fix, the restore script first.

## 2026-09-26 — The review page no longer lists problems that were already fixed (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.37`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0531`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the book's review page, where a reader looks for what is still wrong, listed 24 problems whose fixes had already landed, some of them weeks earlier, and in two places contradicted its own summary table.
- ✅ **Now:** every one of the 24 was checked against the code. 21 now say what was fixed and how things work today, one says it was never a problem, one explains which half was fixed and which was a deliberate decision, and one small remaining gap got its own tracked item. An automatic check now refuses to let the page keep an open problem once all its fixes are done.

## 2026-09-26 — Deployment records no longer blame database failures on the caller (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.6`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0530`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when the database failed while registering a target, assigning a policy, or recording drift, a correction or an outcome, the answer said the record "does not exist", the authority "is not active", or the record "already exists". Someone could re-create or abandon a request that was fine. A badly written expiry date was reported as missing.
- ✅ **Now:** a database failure is reported as the server's problem; "already exists" means exactly that; a badly written date is named as such. The deployment review (`.9.3.3`) is closed.

## 2026-09-26 — A drift record compares against what was actually assigned (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.5`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0529`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a drift record (the note that a target is not running what was published) stored whatever "should be running" value the person recording it typed, so it could disagree with the assignment it was about.
- ✅ **Now:** that value must be the assignment's own, or the record is refused with a message naming it. What the target was seen running is still the observer's report.

## 2026-09-26 — Only a target's own authority can decide what it runs (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.7`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0528`.

- 🔴 **Before:** assigning a published policy to a target only checked that the policy belonged to the person assigning it. Targets are shared across the whole site, so one organization could set what another organization's target should run.
- ✅ **Now:** only whoever holds the target's own authority can assign to it; anyone else is refused as unauthorized.
- 🔎 **Found and fixed:** the review page still listed a problem with policy corrections that was fixed weeks ago. It is corrected, and 10 more entries on that page that may be similarly out of date are tracked (`.11.37`).

## 2026-09-26 — The book no longer implies deployments roll out in stages (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.4`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0182`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the book said a publication is assigned to a target in a "canary wave", which reads as a staged rollout where a failing first group stops the rest. Nothing does that: the wave number is only stored, and the system does not carry out deployments at all yet.
- ✅ **Now:** the book says the wave is a label you choose to group targets, and that nothing holds a later wave back. Rollout ordering is tracked for when the system first carries out a deployment itself.
- 🔎 **Found and tracked:** assigning a publication to a target checks no authority over that target (`.9.3.3.7`, next).

## 2026-09-26 — A target's reports are kept, not overwritten (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.3`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0527`.

- 🔴 **Before:** each time a target reported which policy content it was running, the new report replaced the old one, so what it said before, and who said it, was lost.
- ✅ **Now:** every report is kept as its own record that cannot be edited afterwards, the target's current state is always its latest report, and the full history can be read in order. Reports that arrived before this change had already been lost.

## 2026-09-25 — Only the principal a target names can report what it runs (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0526`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a receipt, the report of which policy content a target is actually running, could be filed by anyone in the owning organization, including the operator who had just said what it *should* run. The comparison that detects a target running the wrong thing was only as honest as whoever posted last.
- ✅ **Now:** a target names one reporter when it is registered (a person or an agent role), and only that principal can file its receipts; anyone else is refused with a message saying so. A target registered before this change takes no receipts until it is given a reporter, which is not possible yet and is tracked for when it is needed.

## 2026-09-25 — A deployment must deploy what its publication published (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.3.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0525`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when someone assigned a published policy to a target, they also typed in which version and which content fingerprint the target should run, and the system only checked that the fingerprint looked like one. A target could be told to run content the publication never had, and later comparisons of "what should be running" against "what is running" used that made-up value.
- ✅ **Now:** the fingerprint must be the publication's own and the version one the publication recorded; anything else is refused with a message naming which one is wrong. The book shows where to read both.
- 🔎 **Found and tracked:** a drift record (the note that a target is not running what was published) still accepts a typed-in fingerprint (`.9.3.3.5`), and the deployment and drift records report a database failure as "does not exist" or "already exists" in 14 places (`.9.3.3.6`).

## 2026-09-25 — A commit check no longer mistakes a setting's name for a waiver (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.2.10`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0524`.

- 🔴 **Before:** one of the automatic checks that runs on every commit treated the name of a setting, `REPEATED_WAIVER_THRESHOLD`, as if someone had written "this check doesn't apply to me", and refused a correct commit.
- ✅ **Now:** the check only reacts to the words it was built for, and it tests itself on every commit against thirteen known examples, so the same kind of mistake cannot come back unnoticed.

## 2026-09-25 — A policy can be reviewed more than once (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.3.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0523`.

- 🔴 **Before:** once a policy had been reviewed for a given reason, it could never be reviewed for that reason again: the system silently failed to create the next review. The same silent failure made a database problem look like "nothing needs review", and a single exception granted to a policy (even an expired one) counted as a "repeated" exception.
- ✅ **Now:** each new problem after a completed review schedules a new review; only one review per policy and reason is open at a time; "repeated exceptions" means at least two still in force within 90 days; and a failure to create a review is reported as an error.

## 2026-09-25 — A database failure is no longer reported as "that record does not exist" (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.2.3`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0522`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when the database failed while the system was recording a policy proposal, decision, approval or publication, the answer said the record the request named "does not exist", or that the approval's proof was invalid. Someone reading that could re-create the record or give up on it, when nothing was wrong with their request.
- ✅ **Now:** a database failure is reported as the server's problem on all of these, and a missing decision is called a decision (it said "proposal"). The policy publication review (`.9.2`) is closed.

## 2026-09-25 — A policy publication can only be finished once (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.2.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0521`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a policy publication ends either "in force" or "failed". If both answers arrived at the same moment, both were accepted, the second overwrote the first, and the record could end up "in force" while still carrying the failure's reason. Both senders were told they had succeeded.
- ✅ **Now:** the first to arrive wins and the other is refused with a message saying what state it found. A missing publication is now called a publication in the error (it said "proposal"), and a database failure is reported as the server's problem rather than as "does not exist".
- 🔎 **Found and tracked:** the same "database failure reported as does not exist" mistake in 14 places of the proposal, decision and approval records (`.9.2.3`, next).

## 2026-09-25 — A refused conversation leaves no trace in the routing log (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.8.2.7`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0520`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when a new conversation was routed to a working style automatically, the routing log was written before the system checked whether the request was allowed. A refused request left a log entry for a conversation that never existed, and re-sending a successful request added a duplicate entry.
- ✅ **Now:** the entry is written as part of creating the conversation, after the permission check, so it exists exactly when the conversation does. The evaluation and routing review (`.8.2`) is closed.

## 2026-09-25 — An experiment can no longer list the same option twice, and its errors say what is wrong (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.8.2.6`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0519`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a routing experiment that listed an option twice gave that option a double share of the test cases, silently; a test case listed twice was stored twice. Separately, most of the evaluation tool's error messages were garbled into a sentence about a malformed fingerprint ("digest `the arms are empty` is not a 64-hex string").
- ✅ **Now:** both repeats are refused with a message naming the repeated item, and every refusal of the evaluation tool says plainly what is wrong.
- 🔎 **Tracked, not urgent:** if a stored baseline were ever damaged, the error would be reported as the user's mistake instead of a server fault; this cannot happen today because baselines are checked when saved (`.8.2.8`).

## 2026-09-25 — Changing an assessment is refused instead of silently ignored (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.7.4.8`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0518`.

- 🔴 **Before:** sending an assessment again with a different quote or explanation was answered "accepted", with the first one's id, and the change was thrown away. In a conversation, the record even showed the new quote while the stored assessment kept the old one.
- ✅ **Now:** sending the same assessment again unchanged still returns the same one; sending it with anything changed is refused, and the message lists exactly what differs. Nothing is half-applied.

## 2026-09-25 — An assessment's author is whoever submitted it (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.7.4.7`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0517`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when someone recorded that a piece of evidence supports (or contradicts) a claim, the request itself said who the author was, and who had verified it. Anyone could put someone else's name on it.
- ✅ **Now:** the server records the person who actually sent it as the author, and a request that tries to name an author or a verifier is refused with a message saying which field is not allowed.
- 🔎 **Found on the way:** a second person verifying an assessment, which the roadmap describes, does not exist yet (tracked, `.7.4.13`); and most routes answer a badly formed request without the error code the book promises (tracked and stated in the book, `.11.36`).

## 2026-09-25 — The two-host demonstration passes again (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.4.4.2.2.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0516`.

- 🔴 **Before:** since the web console's inbox panel was fixed on 2026-09-24, the demonstration's check of the console still looked for the panel's old, broken query and failed. Nothing noticed because everyday test runs skip the demonstration, but the next publication to GitHub would have failed its automated checks on it.
- ✅ **Now:** the check looks for the corrected query and says what it actually checks, and the whole demonstration passes. The book's description of that step was corrected the same way.

## 2026-09-25 — Deleted evidence can no longer be built on, and fetching it again makes fresh evidence (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.7.4.6`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0515`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when an operator or the retention sweep deleted a piece of evidence (it is kept, marked deleted, with a reason), three things still used it: new summaries could be filed against it, assessments could be checked against its text (in a conversation too), and fetching the same content again quietly pointed back at the deleted record.
- ✅ **Now:** the first two are refused with a message naming the deletion and its reason, and fetching the same content again creates a fresh record with its own history and retention period. The deleted record stays readable, as before.
- ⚖️ **Decided and recorded:** a deletion retires one fetched copy, not the content itself. Otherwise a routine expiry would become a permanent ban. Blocking content wherever it appears is a separate feature that does not exist yet (`.7.4.10`), and the book says so.

## 2026-09-25 — The web console no longer shows a late answer under the wrong view (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.1.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0514`.

- 🔴 **Before:** each view cleared the page, fetched, then drew wherever the page was by then. On a slow server, clicking Timeline and then Audit could put the timeline's rows under the Audit heading, and saving a new identity could show the previous tenant's conversations under it.
- ✅ **Now:** each view draws into its own space, which a later click replaces, so a late answer is dropped. The presence and inbox panels keep only the answer to the latest click. Four new browser checks hold one answer back on purpose and confirm it changes nothing when it arrives; each failed on the old page, and six deliberately broken versions of the repair are each caught.
- ✅ **The console review (`.11.1`) is closed.**

## 2026-09-25 — The web console's Timeline works again, and a real browser now checks the console (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.1.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0513`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the Timeline view showed only an error for every conversation that had any events. A number reached a piece of the page that only accepted text, and no test ever opened the console in a browser, so nothing noticed.
- ✅ **Now:** every value on the page is shown as text. A new check opens the console in the pinned test browser against a real server and database, clicks through it the way an operator does, and compares what the page shows with what the server returned. It also puts HTML in a conversation's title and confirms it stays text and never runs. The check failed on the old page with the exact error an operator saw, and three deliberately broken versions of the repair each fail it.
- 🔎 **Found on the way:** the browser used by the web-page reading tool (off unless switched on) contacts Google services by itself: time, accounts, updates and a messaging registration. The book now says so, and `.7.3.7` owns the fix.

## 2026-09-25 — The web console checked point by point: no security hole, but one view is broken (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.1`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0180`.

- ✅ The feared problem, other people's data running as code in an administrator's browser, is not possible with how the console builds its pages.
- 🔴 To fix: the Timeline view fails for every conversation that has any events (a number reaches a piece of code that only accepts text), and no test ever opens the console in a real browser, which is why nobody noticed. Also, a slow view can appear under the heading of the view you switched to.

## 2026-09-25 — A cancelled Claude or Codex request is no longer recorded as a definite failure (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.10.1.4`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0512`.

- 🔴 **Before:** cancelling a request stops its program, and the connection then recorded "the provider failed", which nobody knows: the provider may well have finished the work.
- ✅ **Now:** a program stopped from outside (a cancel, or any other forced stop) leaves the result marked "unknown", which is what the system uses to require care before retrying. A program that reports its own failure is still recorded as a failure.
- ✅ **The Claude and Codex connections review (`.10.1`) is closed:** all four problems it found are fixed; checking token counts against a real receipt waits for a live run.

## 2026-09-25 — Finished or abandoned Claude and Codex programs are cleaned up (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.10.1.3`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0511`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the Claude and Codex connections kept a hold on every program they had ever started, so a request that was given up on left its program running for ever. And a successful answer was reported before its program had even finished.
- ✅ **Now:** every way a request can end waits (for at most a few seconds) for the program to finish and cleans it up, stopping it if it lingers. Giving up on a request stops its program.
- ✅ Tested: both problems shown on the old code by looking at the real processes; every deliberately broken version caught.

## 2026-09-25 — The Claude and Codex connections read their output safely (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.10.1.2`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0510`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when reading what the Claude or Codex program printed, the connection could crash on some non-English error text, held a line of any size in memory before checking it, and kept the start of the error log instead of the end, where the actual error is. Worse, one garbled error line made it stop listening, and the program was then killed the next time it wrote an error.
- ✅ **Now:** both connections share one careful reader: every line has a size limit (tied to the overall output limit, checked when the software is built), error text is always read to the end and its last part kept, and non-English text is cut safely.
- ✅ Tested: all five problems shown on the old code (one turned out to be a crash, not the stall first suspected); every deliberately broken version caught or explained.

## 2026-09-25 — A prompt can no longer be read as a Codex command-line option (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.10.1.1`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0509`.

- 🔴 **Before:** the Codex connection handed the prompt to the Codex program without the usual "end of options" marker (`--`). A prompt starting with `-`, which can come from any participant, could therefore be read by the program as an option, placed right after the setting that keeps it read-only.
- ✅ **Now:** the marker is there, as it already was for Claude. A project check refuses any change that removes it, or that adds a second one (which would quietly switch the read-only setting off).
- ✅ Tested: the check failed on the old code and passes now; a deliberately broken version that first slipped through led to the stricter rule.

## 2026-09-25 — The Claude and Codex connections checked point by point: three hold, four to fix, one deferred (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.10.1`)

`REASONBRAID-DOC-0179`.

- Checked against the code: the overall output limit, the "never started" failure, and the Claude connection's handling of the prompt all hold.
- 🔴 To fix, in this order: the Codex connection hands the prompt to the Codex program in a way that lets text starting with `-` be read as a program option (new, and the most serious); its output reading has no size limit, can crash on some non-English text, and can stall; finished programs are never cleaned up; and a cancelled request is recorded as a definite failure.
- ⏸️ Deferred: checking the token counts against a real provider receipt, which needs a live run.

## 2026-09-25 — Policy error messages say what actually happened, and policy registration's review is complete (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.1.7`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0508`.

- 🔴 **Before:** several policy error messages said the opposite of the truth. A policy that did not exist was reported as "not registered … already exists". When the database itself failed, the server answered as if the request were wrong ("not registered"), instead of saying it had a problem. Version numbers were called "semantic" but accepted `1` and refused `1.2.3-rc.1`.
- ✅ **Now:** each refusal has its own accurate message, a database failure is reported as the server's own error, and version numbers follow the real Semantic Versioning standard.
- ✅ **Policy registration and authority (`.9.1`) is closed:** all six problems its review found are fixed; the deeper parts that matter only once policies are used as binding rules are scheduled for then.
- ✅ Tested: 14 problems shown on the old code; 24 deliberately broken versions caught, including simulated database failures.

## 2026-09-25 — The policy resolver's checks now refuse what they should (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.1.6`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0507`.

- 🔴 **Before:** when several policies are combined for one target, a rule that needs "version 2 of X" was satisfied by version 1, or by an X that does not even apply there. A loop of three policies each claiming priority over the next was accepted, while the server's own explanation said there was no loop. Naming the same policy twice was reported as a conflict with itself, and two versions of one policy could be combined.
- ✅ **Now:** a dependency must apply at the exact version it names, a priority loop of any length is refused and named, a policy named twice is refused as such, and the shapes of these entries are checked when a policy is registered. The manual gained a section that explains, step by step, how policies are combined.
- ⚖️ Decided: a policy's "draft/active" label is set once and never changes, and a policy is put into force by approval and publication. So the label is shown, not acted on. Making labels change over time is deferred until policies are used as binding rules.
- ✅ Tested: all nine problems were shown on the old code; the fix was checked against 42 deliberately broken versions, all caught.

## 2026-09-25 — A mistyped policy selector is refused instead of matching everything (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.1.5`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0506`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a policy says where it applies (and where it does not) with small "selectors". A selector with a missing or misspelt part was read as "everywhere", so one typo could apply a rule to every target, or switch it off for every target.
- ✅ **Now:** a selector must name both its layer and its target, with `*` written out where "everything" is meant. Anything else is refused when the policy is registered, and an old stored one that does not make sense stops the resolution with a clear message instead of being guessed at.
- ✅ Tested: the new check failed on the old code and passes now; 17 deliberately broken versions and one more by hand were all caught; the full live suite (554 tests) and strict lint pass.

## 2026-09-25 — The policy lock file is written by the server, not by the requester (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.9.1.4`)

`REASONBRAID-REPAIR-0505`.

- 🔴 **Before:** a published policy bundle comes with a lock file, a receipt listing which rule versions went into it and who stands behind each. The server copied that receipt from whatever the requester typed, so it could list a rule that was never used, a made-up fingerprint, or someone else's authority. Shown live: a forged receipt was published.
- ✅ **Now:** the server writes the receipt itself, one line per rule the request named, read from the registry. A request that tries to supply its own is refused, and a rule whose stored fingerprint no longer matches its text is never put on a receipt.
- ✅ Tested: both new checks failed on the old code and pass now; four deliberately broken versions were caught; the manual's projection examples now work and are run by a test.

The entries before those above were rotated into reachable Git history at the
**seventeenth rotation** (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.4.1.6`, which owns this ledger’s rotation). The exact predecessor — this file as it
stood at the commit named below, which is the object every retired record was
checked against before this notice was written — is:

```bash
git show 8626d473f4ba3f15d461576da0b55b143938c5fc:LIVE_STATUS.md
```

That snapshot is 53382 bytes and 455 lines, and contains 54 dated
entries; its Git blob is `41b1764bc469a5a0da8430f99409bbd6f5c16e4b` and its SHA-256 is
`4e03c9b491c5ba7f9353cfacd918678f70660361a7a95d96945bee4b53f8e600`. It carries the sixteenth rotation's
notice in turn, and each earlier notice names the one before it, so the chain
walks all the way back. `docs/decisions/2026-09-09_changelog-rotation.md` holds
the first transition's evidence.

⛔ **13 record(s) rotated out, 42 kept, lossless** — every retired heading was retrieved from the
predecessor named above before this notice was written, and every figure in it was re-derived from that object with
`git rev-parse`, `git cat-file` and SHA-256 rather than typed. ⭐ The cut is DERIVED, not chosen: it retires whole
records until the ledger has at least 10 commits of runway at the p90 entry size measured over the last
60 non-rotation commits — because two rotations that stopped at the threshold instead left 344 and 296 bytes and
the first forced another rotation on the very next commit (`SIGNOFF-REPAIR.11.4.1.6`).
