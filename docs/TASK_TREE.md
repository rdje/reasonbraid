# Task-Tree Workflow

This document defines the repo-local task-tree workflow. A step-by-step setup guide is in
[TASK_TREE_README.md](TASK_TREE_README.md). Individual trees live under
[`tasks/`](tasks/); the leaf template is [`tasks/TEMPLATE.md`](tasks/TEMPLATE.md).

## Purpose

Use a task tree when a top-level task is too broad to finish safely as one signoff-quality
slice, or when it is expected to discover subtasks over time. The tree owns the recursive
breakdown, current frontier, acceptance criteria, blockers, decisions, validation, and
completion evidence for one top-level task — so the project survives a lost session and
continuity holds across sessions, machines, and harness switches.

The tree is not a second roadmap. `ROADMAP.md` states the high-level direction; a task tree
owns the disciplined execution of one lane of it.

## Code-change doctrine (binding, non-negotiable)

**It is strictly forbidden to make any code change unless it is first tracked/owned by a
task-tree leaf.** "Code change" = any edit to Rust sources, `Cargo.toml`/build scripts,
generated artifacts, or anything altering behavior. Before touching code, a leaf must exist
that owns the change (create/extend a tree, or add a leaf). The leaf — its goal, acceptance,
verification, and commit — is the unit of traceability. Enforced by
`scripts/check_task_tree_ownership.sh`.

## Leaf lifecycle (statuses)

`proposed` → `pending` → `active`/`in_progress` → `done`. A leaf is `done` only when its
acceptance criteria are met, verification is recorded, and it is committed via `COMMIT.md`.
Mark `blocked` (with the blocker named) rather than leaving a stalled leaf `active`.

## The pivot rule

**Do not pivot to a different task-tree while the repo is dirty.** The repo is
handoff-ready only when the tree is clean (no modified/untracked work except the task-tree
file itself). Finish the current leaf and get the repo clean before switching — even if
asked to pivot immediately. The guarantor of repo integrity holds this line.

## Commit traceability

Each slice uses a work-unit id in the commit subject (e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007`). When the
slice belongs to a leaf, the subject or first body line also names the leaf ID
(e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007 (leaf FEATURE-X.2): …`), so the slice id and the tree node coexist
on the same commit. One commit per completed leaf.

## Active Task Trees

| Tree | Status | Frontier (next leaf) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`BOOTSTRAP`](tasks/BOOTSTRAP.md) | `done` | `.1` — bootstrapped from the ReasonBraid spine | repo-local |
| [`RB-SEED`](tasks/RB-SEED.md) | `done` | `.3` — CLAIM_VERIFICATION adopted | repo-local |
| [`PROGRAM`](tasks/PROGRAM.md) | `active` | index only — current executable tree is `SIGNOFF-REPAIR` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-0`](tasks/PHASE-0.md) | `done` | tree complete — WP1–WP8 + `MAINT-1`/`MAINT-2`; next executable work is `PHASE-1.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-1`](tasks/PHASE-1.md) | `done` | tree complete — G1–G2 **Met** + Demonstration A passed 30/30 (debug + release-built); next executable work is `PHASE-2.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-2`](tasks/PHASE-2.md) | `done` | tree complete — the exit line's properties measured (non-escalation, restore + replacement, no false safe-retry) + the subtraction record; next executable work is `PHASE-3.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-3`](tasks/PHASE-3.md) | `done` | tree complete — the directory, the presence, the matching, the recruitment, the subscriptions, the dependence indicators; next executable work is `PHASE-4.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-4`](tasks/PHASE-4.md) | `done` | tree complete — the five pack lanes + the evidence pipeline; the G4 gate Met (the record + the subtraction + the manifest) | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-5`](tasks/PHASE-5.md) | `done` | tree complete — the five lanes + the G5 gate **Met as a subtraction gate** (the lift claim withdrawn per §25.1; the record + the subtraction + the manifest); next executable work is `PHASE-6.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-6`](tasks/PHASE-6.md) | `done` | tree complete — the seven lanes + the G3 gate **Met as machinery, blocked as binding use** (the record + the subtraction + the Demo-B walk + the manifest); next executable work is `PHASE-7.1` | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-7`](tasks/PHASE-7.md) | `done` | tree complete — the five lanes + the G6–G7 gate package (**NOT MET for the Internet exposure, Met as the hardening-machinery exit** — the gate record + the subtraction + the unsupported matrix + the manifest); next executable work is `PHASE-8.1` | repo-local |
| [`SIGNOFF-REPAIR`](tasks/SIGNOFF-REPAIR.md) | `active` | `.11.14.3.10` — `credential_binding_ref` SELECTS a credential and nothing authorizes the selection; the broker's store carries **no tenant at all** and the pair key makes the field shared. ⚠️ Measured **latent, not live**: the R5 pack is off by default and no production path registers a binding. ⭐ `.13.1.1`'s shape — a finished mechanism with no production producer. ✅ **`.11.14.3.7` IS DONE (REPAIR-0229).** ⭐ **A windowed quota is the WRONG instrument**, measured: the cost is inside ONE request, so a call ceiling bounds arrivals and not how long one request holds the thread's `FOR UPDATE` row. What bounds a request today is **2 MiB**, `axum-core-0.5.6`'s inherited default; declaring it explicitly is a PER-ROUTE decision and was not taken here. The de-duplication ships, DERIVED from the pair key, and de-duplicates the WORK never the RECORD. 🔴 **The transferable part is the DISCARDED instrument**: the repair is invisible to every product surface (the row count is 1 either way), and a `pg_stat_user_tables` scan counter written for it reported the SAME value with and without the repair — a control that passes identically either way measures nothing. Falsified as a unit test over an extracted pure function instead, RED against a locator-keyed implementation. ⚠️ Corrects the leaf's own census: `check_in_tx` has **2** callers. §16.11's real question is `.11.14.3.14`, opened saying it does NOT close this defect. ✅ **`.11.14.3.5`** (REPAIR-0228); ✅ **`.11.14.3.13`** (REPAIR-0227); ✅ **`.11.14.3.11`** (REPAIR-0226); ✅ **`.11.14.3.12`** (REPAIR-0225); ✅ **`.11.14.3.6`** (REPAIR-0224); ✅ **`.11.14.3.4`** (REPAIR-0223); ✅ **`.11.14.3.8`** (REPAIR-0222). | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-8`](tasks/PHASE-8.md) | `active` | corrective prerequisite `SIGNOFF-REPAIR`; then `.5.3` — the store-and-forward (opened at the Phase-7 close; **the `.1`–`.4` lanes COMPLETE**; `.5` the regional-routing census → decomposed `.5.1`–`.5.4`; `.5.1` ADR-035; `.5.2` the regional routing) | repo-local |
| [`PHASE-9`](tasks/PHASE-9.md) | `proposed` | `.1` — stable release | repo-local |
