# PHASE-5: deliberation quality and routing

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `PHASE-5`
- Status: `proposed`
- Roadmap lane: Phase 5 (`ROADMAP.md` §20.7); Quality track
- Created: `2026-09-05`
- Estimate: 15–26 engineer-weeks plus domain-evaluator effort
- Depends on: evidence provenance and stable workflow data
- Exit: G5 on declared domains. If deliberation improves some outcomes but not others, routing and product language reflect that evidence.

## Goal

Treat deliberation quality as an evaluated product hypothesis (H1–H6), not a
consequence of adding agents. Preserve dissent, lineage, evidence, uncertainty,
and honest inconclusive outcomes.

## Non-Goals

- An independence score or rewarding textual disagreement for its own sake.
- Learned routing that can raise authority, spend, data access, or side effects.

## Task Tree

- ID: `PHASE-5.1`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: workflow profile DSL/state machines for consult, parallel review, rigorous deliberation, incident, and policy modes
  Backlog: 36
  ADR: 016
  Roadmap: §13.1–13.2

- ID: `PHASE-5.2`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: blind-first contributions, structured claims/objections/revisions, evidence requests, adjudication, minority reports, unresolved registers
  Roadmap: §13.4, §13.6

- ID: `PHASE-5.3`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: moderator and synthesizer constraints with auditable transformations
  Roadmap: §13.5
  Acceptance: moderator cannot vote, suppress dissent silently, fabricate evidence, change electorate, authorize spend, or publish policy

- ID: `PHASE-5.4`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: versioned evaluation service, randomized routing experiments, cohort tracking, calibration, regression gates
  Backlog: 37
  ADR: 017
  Roadmap: §13.7, §19.5

- ID: `PHASE-5.5`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: deterministic/constrained routing policy; learned routing only after a rule-based baseline and sufficient data, shadow mode first
  Roadmap: §13.8

- ID: `PHASE-5.6`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: G5 exit on declared domains; honest inconclusive behavior; subtract unsupported quality claims
  Gate: G5; subtraction record required
  Kill/pivot: `ROADMAP.md` §25.1 after Phase 5

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | `PHASE-5.1` | `proposed` | blocked on evidence provenance and stable workflows |

## Changelog

- `2026-09-05`: Created from `ROADMAP.md` §20.7, §13, backlog 36–37.
