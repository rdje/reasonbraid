# scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh — THE PROJECT-SPECIFIC DOCTRINE SLOT.
#
# This is where a project instantiated from the template adds ITS OWN mechanizable
# doctrine checks — the equivalent of PGEN's "EBNF is the single source of truth",
# "regex self-hosts", "cert-coverage / shape-contract gates", etc.
#
# It runs LAST in scripts/check_doctrines.sh. Exit 0 = all project doctrines pass;
# exit nonzero (with a message on stderr) = a breach that blocks the commit.
#
# The template ships this as a passing no-op. Add checks below as your project grows;
# keep each one cheap, deterministic, and self-describing. For anything heavier than a
# few seconds, gate it in CI instead and keep this hook fast.

#     echo "PROJECT: rustfmt drift — run 'cargo fmt --all'" >&2; exit 1
